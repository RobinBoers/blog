I had challenged myself to put away my phone for an entire month. In this post, I\u0026rsquo;d like to share my experience.\nBut, why would I want to do this? I found myself glued to my phone a lot lately. At home, when I woke up, in the evening, at school, and even on the toilet. In addition, I also noticed it was annoying me everyone expects you to always be available.\nSo, how\u0026rsquo;d it go? I have to say I quite enjoyed the peace it gave me, however, I was counting down in the last week. And in free periods and breaks at school, when all my friends were playing games without me, I did miss my phone a bit. But I also liked to not be distracted the whole time, and it also motivated me to think of other ways to spend my time when I was bored. I finished three books in the first week alone in just the breaks at school.\nThere were a few problems tho. My school is in Schiedam, and I always make my homework together with my best friend Kevin, but calling is quite hard without a phone. Discord for the rescue, but it just isn\u0026rsquo;t as practical as Whatsapp is. My school schedule is also on my phone, and it just isn\u0026rsquo;t feasible to start my computer every morning at 6 o\u0026rsquo;clock. Which means I was too early at school five times.\nI do realize now that with exception of some really important communication my phone isn\u0026rsquo;t that important at all. I deleted YouTube and Reddit straight away, and those apps aren\u0026rsquo;t coming back (ever).\nIt is a bit strange that we always have to be available. Instant messaging is cool and all because it allows you to have conversations over great distances, but it also creates the expectation that you\u0026rsquo;ll respond to every message straight away.\nMaybe people will tell me that to use my laptop for school and work is cheating. But that is like saying eating vegetables when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to eat no sugar is cheating. The goal wasn\u0026rsquo;t to completely get rid of devices or to cut me from all communications. I just wanted to experience what it is like to not be available at any time of the day and to find alternative ways to spend my time. Besides, it was also interesting to see how this would affect my social life.\nConclusion? It was certainly an informative experience. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I would recommend it, but if you feel inspired I would encourage you to try it.\n","date":"2022-03-05T12:54:39+01:00","site":"https://blog.geheimesite.nl/en","tags":null,"title":"A phoneless month.","uri":"https://blog.geheimesite.nl/en/post/a-phoneless-month/"},{"author":{"about":"I'm a webdesigner, programmer, and nerd living in the Netherlands.

But first, how did I do last year? Well, in this post I wrote about my progress in 2021. Quick recap:\n I wanted to learn Express (servers) I wanted to build GTK+ apps I wanted to learn React to build mobile apps with React Native I wanted to create 3D games and prototypes using Three.js  So, did I accomplish these goals? Well, sorta. I didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything with GTK. Mostly because the docs suck, and for Node.js they are even worse. I might try Granite in the future. Who knows? But GTK and Linux deserve a whole post on their own.\nI also got a bit distracted by Svelte, and I wrote a little app using Svelte instead of learning React as I planned. I still want to learn React because I like the idea to write iOS and Android apps using React Native. I recently saw this talk about integrating React Native with Phoenix Framework, which sounds cool.\nI totally forgot Express to be honest. That may also illustrate how much I was actually interested in it.\nBut to end on a positive note: I\u0026rsquo;ve got a job at Qdentity since September 2021. I mentioned Phoenix Framework earlier in this post, and that is because that is what they use at Qdentity. So I\u0026rsquo;m learning Elixir and Phoenix now. Phoenix is a framework to build interactive websites and web apps in Elixir. You\u0026rsquo;ll hear me talk about it a lot more this year, so be prepared :)\nOh, I almost forgot: my plans for this year. I already mentioned Phoenix and Elixir, but I\u0026rsquo;m also still interested in React and React Native. Also cool: I\u0026rsquo;ve got a new app I\u0026rsquo;m working on. It\u0026rsquo;s called Nindo and you\u0026rsquo;re using it right now because I published this blog post via Nindo.\nHappy new year everyone!\n","date":"2022-01-03T09:09:26+01:00","site":"https://blog.geheimesite.nl/en","tags":null,"title":"Plans and projects for 2022","uri":"https://blog.geheimesite.nl/en/post/plans-and-projects-for-2022/"},{"author":{"about":"I'm a webdesigner, programmer, and nerd living in the Netherlands.

I\u0026rsquo;m an enthusiastic developer from the Netherlands. I\u0026rsquo;m also the creator of Nindo, and this is my third blog. For dutch people, I also have a blog over here: Webdevelopment-En-Meer. If you want to know more about me, check my personal website. And for English readers, I also have a second blog where I post about solutions for stupid problems, creatively titled, Stupid Codes.\nEnough about me, what\u0026rsquo;s this new blog all about? Well, like I said before, I already have a dutch blog where I regularly post about programming and my other hobbies. This blog is an attempt to reach a broader audience for my posts.\nSo what kind of posts can you expect? I mostly talk about programming and new stuff I learn, but also about software-development as a whole. I\u0026rsquo;m also a Linux enthusiast, so you\u0026rsquo;ll also see me talk about Linux and open-source in general a lot.\nSo, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested you can follow me via RSS or via follow.it\nAnd then I will see you again when I post my very creative and fun posts :)\n- Robin\n","date":"2021-12-25T10:35:23+01:00","site":"https://blog.geheimesite.nl/en","tags":null,"title":"Hi, I'm that Crazy Webdev!","uri":"https://blog.geheimesite.nl/en/post/im-that-crazy-webdev/"}]
