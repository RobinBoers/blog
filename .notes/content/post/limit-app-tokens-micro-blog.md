@manton, is it possible to limit the scope of an app token? I self-host my micro.blog using GitHub Pages, but like to display books from my Bookshelves on my site. It worked using a JS script I wrote, but it has an app token exposed in the source code. I'd like to limit the scope of that token to only allow read-only access to my content.
